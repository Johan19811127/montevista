        <p className="text-default mb-3 text-justify">
          Monte Vista Primary School strives towards the highest standards of teaching and education. This is accomplished by the close co-operation and mutual support of the role players in the education triangle: the educator, the learner, and the parent.
        </p>
         <p className="text-default mb-3 text-justify">
          Therefore, the Code of Conduct of the Monte Vista Primary School was compiled according to the South African Schools’ Act 1996 (Act 84 of 1996) and the Guidelines for a Code of Conduct for learners (as proclaimed in the Government Gazette of 15 May 1998) to assist with the effective management of the school. This was also done to offer a framework against which the educator, learner, and parent can measure their own acceptable conduct.
        </p>
         <p className="text-default mb-3 text-justify">
          With this code of conduct, the school undertakes to maintain the rights of learners, parents, and educators.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-3" id="">H. Levels of Application of Discipline</h2>
         <p className="text-default mb-3 text-justify">
          In order to maintain and promote good order and discipline, a system of merits (positive points) and demerits (negative points) has been implemented. Monte Vista uses the App Class Dojo as the discipline system. This App allows educators, parents, and learners to interact constructively. Educators have the ability to load merits and demerits and to communicate it with parents and learners. Parents need to have an account on Class Dojo to be able to view their child’s behaviour at school.
        </p>
         <p className="text-default mb-3 text-justify">
          The merit and demerit points work separately from each other and do not have an effect on each other.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold my-2">1. Merits (Positive Points)</h3>
         <p className="text-default mb-3 text-justify">Each class has its own reward system whereby learners are rewarded for the merits that they work for.</p>

         <p className="text-default mb-3 text-justify">Each educator with the help of Class Dojo decides upon the first level of discipline. Rules and boundaries are set. The learner’s behaviour must comply with these rules and remain within the set boundaries in order to have good order inside and outside the classroom. On this level the educator determines the severity of this misconduct and the learner will receive a negative point in his/her Class Dojo profile. After 10 negative points the learner will stay for detention. Positive points and negative points are separate and do not impact each other.</p>
         <p className="text-default mb-3 text-justify">A detention session will last 2 hours at school on a given Friday afternoon where the learners will reflect on their behaviour.</p>

Here a possible solution to the problems of the learner will be discussed and the group of educators will decide upon a suitable punishment.</p>

         <p className="text-default mb-3 text-justify">
          While applying discipline, a policy of positive reinforcement of exemplary behaviour is encouraged. According to this policy good behaviour is rewarded with positive Dojo points. Each class will have a reward system for achieving a set amount of Dojo points. This serves as motivation and positive reinforcement of good behaviour.
        </p>
         <p className="text-default mb-3 text-justify">
          The school&apos;s policy is that punishment will not be applied in the spirit of retribution. Punishment is applied to correct the misbehaviour of the learner to the benefit of the learner and other learners. The mutual cooperation between parents and educator remains of the utmost importance.
