<ul className="mb-5 list-disc">
<li className="text-default">The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.</li>
<li className="text-default ">The SA Schools Act of 1996.</li>
<li className="text-default ">The Provincial Gazette Extraordinary #5136 of 16 May 1997</li>
<li className="text-default ">The Provincial Gazette Extraordinary #5212 of 9 December 1997</li>
<li className="text-default ">The Government Gazette #18480</li>

<li  className="text-default">The Monte Vista Primary School Constitution</li>

</ul>
<h2 className="text-xl font-bold my-6">POLICY PROVISIONS</h2>
<ol className="list-decimal">
<li  className="text-default mb-2">Learners may be enrolled at 5 years turning 6 by 30 June into grade one. Preference will be given to learners who turn 7 during their Grade 1 year. The learnerâ€™s age should not exceed his Grade plus 6 for admission.</li>
<li  className="text-default mb-4">Our class structure is as follows:
<ul className="list-disc my-2 ml-5">
<li  className="text-default">Grade R: 4 English classes with 25 learners each</li>

<li  className="text-default">Gr 5 - 7: 3 English classes and 1 Afrikaans class with 35 learners each</li>

</ul>
Monte Vista Primary School makes provision for learners repeating a grade. We also reserve the right to keep up to 3 spaces available for late admissions received in the event that parents relocate into the direct or secondary feeder areas of the school after the closing of admissions.

</li>


<li  className="text-default mb-3">The age of the learner should not exceed two years above or below the chronological average age of the Grade. Chronological average age is calculated as the grade number plus 6. e.g. Learners in Grade 1 should be 6 + 1 = 7. Learners 9 and older may not be accepted into the grade without the permission of the head of education.</li>
<li  className="text-default mb-3">In terms of par 30 of the National Admission Policy, learners who are in the school system, but who have become over-age because of repeating grades, may not be refused continued education at a school, but, when transferring from one school to another, may be admitted only with the approval of the circuit team manager. The prescripts and procedures are described in Circular 240/2003.</li>
<li  className="text-default mb-3">The learner should be a resident in Monte Vista, Edgemead and Plattekloof Glen. The feeder area is determined by the child's permanent residence being closer to the school than any other school. Applications that come from our secondary feeder areas: Bothasig, Burgundy Estate (east of Tygerberg Valley Rd), Goodwood, Panorama, Welgelegen and Plattekloof will be placed on a waiting list until placement can be made.
    <p>Parents that are employed by the WCED or SGB who work at Monte Vista Primary School, may enrol their children in the applicable grade as set out in point 3 of this policy document.</p>
